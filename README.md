# Galaxy Gram

## Our Awesome Project!!

Welcome to GalaxyGram, the final frontier! Boldly going where (hopefully) no Kenzie students have gone before.

Here, you can look up your favorite exoplanets -- we have them all listed here, thanks to an API.

You can can also make your own posts about the planets, and upload your own amateur photos and artwork.

To use on your own machine, clone the repo, poetry add your dependencies, and may the Force be with you!
